ðŸ”— [Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MwFyCJE0SofZ-hK2SZC_bxyt-kP3q1K4?usp=drive_link)

Put all datasets into the 'data' folder.

## Run
1. **VRI**:
   
   ```bash
   #CLID-MU
   bash submit_vri_clid.sh
   ```
   
   ```bash
   #Baselines
   bash submit_vri_base.sh
   ```   
2. **WNet**
   ```bash
   #CLID-MU
   bash submit_wnet_clid.sh
   ```
   ```bash
   #Baselines
   bash submit_wnet_base.sh
   ```
## SSL and SOTA
The code for integrating CLID-MU with semi-supervised learning (SSL) and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods can be found in the *semi* and *sota* folders, respectively.
